# When Keep clients request a list of Keep services from the API
# server, use the origin IP address to determine if the request came
# from the internal subnet or it is an external client.  This sets the
# $external_client variable which in turn is used to set the
# X-External-Client header.
#
# The API server uses this header to choose whether to respond to a
# "available keep services" request with either a list of internal keep
# servers (0) or with the keepproxy (1).
#
# Following the example here, update the 10.20.30.0/24 netmask
# to match your private subnet.
# Update 1.2.3.4 and add lines as necessary with the public IP
# address of all servers that can also access the private network to
# ensure they are not considered 'external'.
